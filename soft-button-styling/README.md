# Soft <button> styling

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/dLLxdj](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/dLLxdj).

Each of these buttons is created with a single `<button>` element. The layout is a responsive grid one. Full look uses the `element()` function, so it's only available in Firefox, though it all degrades gracefully.
